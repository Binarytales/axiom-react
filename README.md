## Axiom - Pattern Library

A consumable library of UI & UX patterns, that can take you from a blank page to production without having to worry about styling and design details. Backed by a Style Guide Driven Development approach and a living style guide, documentation does not become a forgotten separate task and is automated at a level that still has flexibility. 

**Status**: In development, unstable, experimental, hazardous ... other off-putting words 

### Getting the Style Guide 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrandwatchLtd/axiom.git
cd axiom 
npm install
npm start # Development
npm run prod # Production
```
